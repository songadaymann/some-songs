have user action trigger modal login popup for not logged in users:
artist.jsp
profile.jsp
recent.jsp

playlists:
searching - advanced
max number of songs...?
need to add more ways to add songs to playlists from more places (song list, etc.)

songs:
make sure links point to actual mp3s?

general:
ajax spinner next to ratings
replace Hibernate cascade delete N+1 statements with minimum number of bulk delete statements necessary (plus cache flushing?)
refactor logic out of controllers into services
consolidate song rating javascript (is in two places, song.js, and song_list.js)
cut down on spring config: bean name handler, multiaction controllers, etc.
use spring's ServletRequestUtils, instead of commons classes
add user preference to have mp3 player open in new window, respond to play/pause links there, instead of playing in each page
(requested by frankie, wants it to work more like thesixtyone.com, which does the whole "no page reloading" thing, without frames)
use a common interface or base class among SongComment, SongCommentReply, PlaylistComment, PlaylistCommentReply, and MessageBoardPost
add reference to Song in SongCommentReply, Playlist in PlaylistCommentReply
move User profile info into new UserProfile entity?
add second step, e.g. confirmation, to message to admin, to try to block spam

search:
-"comments" search? don't know what this does, not going to try to duplicate it
ignore ignored users
- issue: num replies for comments is fixed, doesn't take into account ignored users ...
need a search to find non-hidden songs you haven't commented on yet
probably don't need advanced search form page, just show/hide advanced options on search page using javascript
fix javascript issue on artist.jsp with saving searches
log searches run: search id, user id, timestamp? or count, last run timestamp in search?
sort list of saved searches by date last run?
full text searches, using lucene 

user:
give user preference for default search, select from system searches and saved searches

admin:
different admin levels? message board admin? song admin? comment/reply admin? user admin?
add admin UI for viewing/disabling playlist ratings (clone song rating stuff)

problem:
some songs don't play on the playlist page in IE/Windows (songs from SF! archives)

message board:

jmann:

general:
replace prototype/scriptaculous with jquery/jquery-ui
